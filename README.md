# arch-configs
my arch configs! for making my install easier next time :)

most of this is shamelessly stolen from swayos but it has ✨✨adam configs✨✨

this should be a living repo where i can update files and propegate changes to all my machines :)

if you aren't me dont judge me i hate ux and i'm happy with my choices
